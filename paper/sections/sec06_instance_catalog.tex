\begin{itemize}
	\item Commercial MIP solver (CPLEX) result: optimality gap, integrality gap (LP relaxation gap, tightness), solution time, obj value
	\item DD solver (DSP) result: optimality gap, duality gap (convex relaxation gap), solution time, obj value
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Computational environment}
We perform the computational experiments on the accompanied instances with \siplibtwo. All the experiments were run on \textit{Bebop}, a 1024-node computing cluster at Argonne National Laboratory \cite{bebop}. For consistent results, we only use one node and one core for each instance. Each node in bebop has

\subsubsection {Basic results from the two solvers}
\noindent\textit{Best objective value, Solution time}

\subsubsection{Three different gaps}
We report three gaps for each instances.
