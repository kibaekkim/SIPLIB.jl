The first \siplib\ was constructed in 2002 by Shabbir Ahmed and his colleagues. The library has been providing a collection of test instances to facilitate computational and algorithmic research in SIP. State-of-the-art in SIP combined with the speedup in computing machinery, however, has made many SIPLIB instances trivial.
By \siplibtwo\, we provide 1) richer collection of test instances with benchmarking computational results, 2) not only \texttt{SMPS} files but also utilities for generating/analyzing instances. \siplibtwo\ is implemented in Julia programming language with modeling package \texttt{StructJuMP} (block-structured optimization framework for Julia mathematical programming).
