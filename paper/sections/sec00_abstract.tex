\siplib\ was first constructed in 2002 by Shabbir Ahmed and his colleagues. It has been providing a collection of test instances to facilitate computational and algorithmic research in SIP. State-of-the-art in SIP combined with the speedup in computing machinery, however, requires more test instances than currently available sets.

By \siplibtwo\, we provide richer collection of test instances accompanied with both analytical and computational information. We also provide a software package for generating/analyzing instances. The package is implemented in \julia\ programming language, which is powerful as well as simple, with structured algebraic modeling package \structjump\ (block-structured optimization framework for \julia\ mathematical programming).
