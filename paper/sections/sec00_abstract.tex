\siplib\ was first constructed in 2002 by Shabbir Ahmed and his colleagues. It has been providing a collection of test instances to facilitate computational and algorithmic research in SIP. State-of-the-art in SIP combined with the speedup in computing machinery, however, has made many \siplib\ instances trivial.
By \siplibtwo\, we provide richer collection of test instances with benchmarking computational results. We not only provide \smps\ files but also a software package for generating/analyzing instances. The package for \siplibtwo\ is implemented in \julia\ programming language with structured algebraic modeling package \structjump\ (block-structured optimization framework for \julia\ mathematical programming).
