Handling uncertainty is always complicating but unavoidable consideration in real world problems. SIP is one of the useful modeling frameworks that has been effectively addressing the issue. Also, unceasing efforts of researchers in this field is making great progress in terms of the range of problems that are conquered. 

Still, we believe that there are many rooms to be pioneered for improvement in SIP. Since SIP can be viewed as a special case of MIP with special structure, they share many characteristics in common. No one can confidently say the universally effective measures of complexity in both MIP and SIP so far, however, most researchers would agree with some factors are definitely related, e.g., the type of the variables, size (rows and columns) of the instance, and tightness/symmetry of the formulation. Some of them cannot be easily measured whereas some can be directly obtained in explicit form. We investigated each of them sometimes analytically and sometimes computationally.

In this study, we also try to provide pivotal platform as well as a milestone for further improvement in SIP by discussing the issues in SIP and implementing convenient functionalities. Using relatively new language \julia\ hence can be unfamiliar, but which is most convenient to the best of our knowledge, is a part of that spirit. 

Although the endemic broad viewpoint of this study restricts deeper investigation on every different problem, we suggest researchers to dig into any one of the topics or problems more intensively. Any further contribution or suggestion for \siplibtwo\ is always welcomed. Better solutions than discovered so far, more convenient functions, more interesting problems with \julia\ scripts, more effective analysis, and so on.
