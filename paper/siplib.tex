\section{Introduction}
(What is SIPLIB?) The \texttt{SIPLIB} \cite{web:SIPLIB1} is an abbreviated term of the Stochastic Integer Programming (SIP) LIBrary firstly contructed in 2002 by Shabbir Ahmed and his colleagues. The library has been providing a collection of test problems with instances to facilitate computational and algorithmic research in SIP. Test problems have been added to \texttt{SIPLIB} gradually and now it provides nine different problems in total.  The instances are basically given in the standard \texttt{SMPS} format accompanied with additional information including parameter data, size of the instance in the number of rows, columns, and integers, benchmark data such as best known objective value or bounds, optimality gap, and solution time.

(Motivation) At the time \texttt{SIPLIB} appeared, it provided enoughly large-sized instances that is reasonable to argue that the performance of algorithm is remarkable if it solves the instances. The state-of-art in SIP together with vastly increased computational power, however, makes many instances of \texttt{SIPLIB} trivial so that we have no more basis to use \texttt{SIPLIB} for showing the excellence of new solution methods. At this point, we are motivated to develop a compatible second version of \texttt{SIPLIB}, say, \texttt{SIPLIB2.0} that provides larger-sized test problems with higher degree of tailorability.

(What SIP is and our restriction) Stochastic programming (SP) is a framework for modeling optimization problems that involve uncertaity. Whereas optimization problems are typically formulated with known parameters, the problems in real world contain some unknown parameters in many cases. For details on SP, see, e.g., \cite{web:SPS,book:BL2011}. SIP is a branch of SP that indicates any type of SP including at least one integer decision variable. The integers can be placed anywhere in general SIP. However, we restrict our focus on two-stage SIP that contains integer variables (including binary) in its second stage throughout this paper and \texttt{SIPLIB2.0}. The main reason is that the class of SIP is most widely used to model real world problems. Moreover, two-stage SIP itself has enough difficulties that have not been conquered yet without any other details like chance-constraints and multi-stages. The main difficulty in solving two-stage SIP is that the second-stage value function is not necessarily convex, but only lower semicontinuous. Thus, the standard decomposition approaches that work nicely for stochastic \textit{linear} programs, break down when the second stage integer variables are present \cite{journal:AG2003}. Hereinafter, we use the term SIP to indicate the two-stage SIP that contains integer variables in its second stage.

(SMPS, Julia)
We provide the problem sets in two formats: \texttt{SMPS} files (*.cor, *.tim, *.stoch) and \texttt{Julia} files (*.jl). \texttt{SMPS} is widely used to describe stochastic linear and quadratic programs. Once having \texttt{SMPS} files of a problem instance, we can directly solve it using various mixed integer linear program (MILP) solvers such as \texttt{CPLEX}, \texttt{GUROBI}, and \texttt{CBC}. One can also use the existing open-source SIP solvers like \texttt{DSP} \cite{journal:KZ2015}, \texttt{PySP} \cite{journal:WWH2012}, and \texttt{SMI} \cite{web:SMI} if \texttt{SMPS} files are given. One drawback of \texttt{SMPS} format is its low readability by human. We decided to provide \texttt{Julia} files to let users be able to easily read problems and tailor the instances.

(Convenience of Julia) \texttt{Julia} is an open source high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for numerical computing. It is also known as its good performance, approaching that of statically-compiled languages like \texttt{C}. The syntax of \texttt{Julia} is simple and should feel familiar to anyone who has experienced in other high-level languages like \texttt{MATLAB} or \texttt{Python}. A \texttt{Julia} package called \texttt{JuMP} (Julia for Mathematical Programming \cite{web:JuMP}) provides a domain-specific modeling language for mathematical optimization embedded in \texttt{Julia}. \texttt{JuMP} enables us to easily translate mathematical models to \texttt{JuMP.Model}-type object. Some structured mathematical model like SIP can also be translated to the \texttt{JuMP.Model}-type object combined with a package \texttt{StructJuMP} \cite{web:StructJuMP}. Once we have \texttt{JuMP.Model}-type object of mathematical model, it is easy to modify and convert to \texttt{SMPS} files. For each problem in \texttt{SIPLIB2.0}, we provide a \texttt{Julia} script for constructing \texttt{JuMP.Model}-type object. We also provide a \texttt{Julia} script (SmpsWriter.jl) for converting any \texttt{JuMP.Model}-type objects to \texttt{SMPS} files for users' convenience.

(Contribution of SIPLIP2.0) By \texttt{SIPLIB2.0}, we provide 1) richer collection of test problems for computational and algorithmic research in SIP with benchmarking computational results, 2) not only \texttt{SMPS} files but also \texttt{Julia} files that are easily readable/tailorable.
