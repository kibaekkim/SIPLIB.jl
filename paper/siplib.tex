\section{Introduction}
(What is SIPLIB?) The \texttt{SIPLIB} \cite{web:SIPLIB1} is an abbreviated term of the Stochastic Integer Programming (SIP) LIBrary firstly contructed in 2002 by Shabbir Ahmed and his colleagues. The library has been providing a collection of test instances to facilitate computational and algorithmic research in SIP. Some new test problems with instances have been added to \texttt{SIPLIB} gradually and now it contains nine different problems in total.  The instances are basically given in the standard \texttt{SMPS} format accompanied with additional information including parameter data, size of the instance in the number of rows, columns, and integers, benchmark data such as best known objective value or bounds, optimality gap, and solution time.

(Motivation) At the time \texttt{SIPLIB} appeared, it provided enoughly large-sized instances that is reasonable to argue that the performance of algorithm is remarkable if it solves the instances. The state-of-art in SIP combined with the speedup in computing machinery, however, makes many instances of \texttt{SIPLIB} trivial so that we have no more basis to use \texttt{SIPLIB} for showing the excellence of new solution methods. At this point, we are motivated to develop the second version of \texttt{SIPLIB}, say \texttt{SIPLIB 2.0} that provides larger-sized test instances with higher degree of tailorability, e.g., users can expand the size of instance sas much as they want in terms of the included number of scenarios.

(What SIP is and our restriction) Stochastic programming (SP) is a framework for modeling optimization problems that involve uncertaity. Whereas optimization problems are typically formulated with known parameters, the problems in real world contain some unknown parameters in many cases. For details on SP, see, e.g., \cite{web:SPS,book:BL2011}. SIP is a branch of SP that indicates any type of SP including at least one integer decision variable. The integers can be placed anywhere in general SIP. However, we restrict our focus on two-stage SIP that contains integer variables (including binary) in its second stage throughout this paper and \texttt{SIPLIB 2.0}. The main reason is that the class of SIP is most widely used to model real world problems. Moreover, two-stage SIP itself has enough difficulties that have not been conquered yet without any other details like chance-constraints and multi-stages. The main difficulty in solving two-stage SIP is that the second-stage value function is not necessarily convex, but only lower semicontinuous. Thus, the standard decomposition approaches that work nicely for stochastic \textit{linear} programs, break down when the second stage integer variables are present \cite{journal:AG2003}. Hereinafter, we use the term SIP to indicate the two-stage SIP that contains integer variables in its second stage.

(SMPS, Julia)
We provide the problem sets in two formats: \texttt{SMPS} files (*.cor, *.tim, *.stoch) and \texttt{Julia} files (*.jl). \texttt{SMPS} is widely used to describe stochastic linear and quadratic programs. Once having \texttt{SMPS} files of a problem instance, we can directly solve it using various mixed integer linear program (MILP) solvers such as \texttt{CPLEX}, \texttt{GUROBI}, and \texttt{CBC}. One can also use the existing open-source SIP solvers like \texttt{DSP} \cite{journal:KZ2015}, \texttt{PySP} \cite{journal:WWH2012}, and \texttt{SMI} \cite{web:SMI} given that \texttt{SMPS} files. One drawback of \texttt{SMPS} format is its low readability by human, which we decided to provide \texttt{Julia} files to let users be able to easily read problems and tailor the instances.

(Convenience of Julia) \texttt{Julia} is an open source high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for numerical computing. It is also known as its good performance, approaching that of statically-compiled languages like \texttt{C} \cite{journal:BEKS2017}. The syntax of \texttt{Julia} is simple and should feel familiar to anyone who has experienced in another high-level languages like \texttt{MATLAB} or \texttt{Python}. A \texttt{Julia} package called \texttt{JuMP} (Julia for Mathematical Programming \cite{web:JuMP}) provides a domain-specific modeling language for mathematical optimization embedded in \texttt{Julia}. \texttt{JuMP} enables us to easily translate mathematical model to \texttt{JuMP.Model}-type object. Some structured mathematical models like SIP can also be translated to the \texttt{JuMP.Model}-type object combined with the package \texttt{StructJuMP} \cite{web:StructJuMP}. Once we have \texttt{JuMP.Model}-type object of mathematical model, it is easy to modify and convert to \texttt{SMPS} files. For each problem in \texttt{SIPLIB 2.0}, we provide a \texttt{Julia} script for constructing \texttt{JuMP.Model}-type object. We also provide a \texttt{Julia} script (SmpsWriter.jl) for converting any \texttt{JuMP.Model}-type objects to \texttt{SMPS} files for users' convenience. Those who feel the given instances are not large enough can simply generate more scenario data by just modifying the parameter in \texttt{Julia} script corresponding to the number of scenarios.

(Contribution of SIPLIP2.0) By \texttt{SIPLIB 2.0}, we provide 1) richer collection of test instances for computational and algorithmic research in SIP with benchmarking computational results, 2) not only \texttt{SMPS} files but also \texttt{Julia} files that are easily readable/tailorable. Hence, the users can obtain as large-sized instances as they need by generating new scenarios and including them into instances. For those who want to utilize the instances in the legacy \texttt{SIPLIB} with strong tailorability provided by \texttt{SIPLIB 2.0}, we include the original \texttt{SIPLIB} instances as well.

\section{Stochastic integer programming}
In this section, we explain general description of SIP. This includes formal mathematical formulation, existing general solution methods to solve the SIPs, and currently available software libraries.
\subsection{Formulation}
In this subsection, we introduce the form of SIP of interest. The notations and dimensional information are summarized in Table \ref{notation:SIP}. We are interested in finding solutions for two-stage SIP of the form: 
\begin{align}
z:=\min_{x\in X}{\left\{c^\top x + \mathcal{Q}(x):\ Ax\ge b\right\}}, \label{eq:SIP_1}
\end{align}
where $\mathcal{Q}(x):=\EE_{\pmb{\xi}}\left[ \phi\left( h(\pmb{\xi})-T(\pmb{\xi})x \right) \right]$ is the second stage recourse function given the random variable $\pmb{\xi}$. We assume that $\pmb{\xi}$ follows a known discrete probability distribution with the finite realizations, called \textit{scenarios}, $\xi_1,\cdots,\xi_r$ and respective nonnegative probabilities $p_1,\cdots,p_r$, i.e., $p_i:=\PP[\pmb{\xi}=\xi_i]$ for $i\in\{1,\ldots,r\}$. When the distribution is continuous, we can aproximate it by a suitably discretized distribution. The real-valued map $\phi:\mathbb{R}^{m_2}\times\mathbb{R}^{+}\to\mathbb{R}$ is the optimal value of the second-stage problem defined by
\begin{align}
\phi(s;\xi):=\min_{y\in Y}\left\{ q(\xi)^\top y:\ W(\xi)y \ge s \right\},\ s\in\mathbb{R}^{m_2}.
\end{align}
The sets $X\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n_1}$ and $Y\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{n_2}$ represent integer or binary restrictions on a subset of the decision variables $x$ and $y$, respectively. 
The first-stage problem data comprise $A$, $b$, and $c$. The second-stage data are given by $T(\xi_j)$, $W(\xi_j)$, $h(\xi_j)$, and $q(\xi_j)$ (for dimensional information refer to Table \ref{notation:SIP}). Hereinafter, we use the simplified notations $(T_j,W_j,h_j,q_j)$.
The SIP (\ref{eq:SIP_1}) can be rewritten in the extensive form
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
z=\min_{x_j,y_j}\ &\sum_{j=1}^{r}p_j\left(c^{\top}x_j+q_j^{\top}y_j\right)	\label{eq:SIP_2-1}\\ 
\mathrm{s.t.}\ &\sum_{j=1}^{r}H_j x_j=0 \label{eq:SIP_2-2} \\
\ &(x_j,y_j)\in G_j,\quad \forall j\in\{1,\ldots,r\},	\label{eq:SIP_2-3}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where the scenario feasibility set $G_j$ is defined as
\begin{align}
G_j:=\left\{ (x_j,y_j): \ Ax_j\ge b,\  T_j x_j+W_j y_j\ge h_j,\ (x_j,y_j)\in X\times Y  \right\}.
\end{align}
The nonanticipativity constraints in (\ref{eq:SIP_2-2}) represent the equations $x_1=x_r$ and $x_j=x_{j-1}$ for $j=2,\ldots,r$, and $H_j$ is a suitable $rn_1\times n_1$ matrix. We assume that SIP does not necessarily have relatively complete recourse. We recall that without this property there can exist an $\hat{x}\in X$ satisfying $A\hat{x}\ge b$ for which there does not exist a recourse $y\in\mathbb{R}^{m_2}$ satisfying $(\hat{x},y)\in G_j$ for some j. In other words, not every choice of the first-stage variables is guaranteed to have feasible recourse for all scenarios.

\section{How to run a test, generate new instance, and convert to \texttt{SMPS}}

We explain the structure of \texttt{SIPLIB 2.0}. We explain procedure to generate new instances with user-generated scenario data using \texttt{Julia} scripts. We explain how to convert \texttt{JuMP.Model}-type object to \texttt{SMPS} files.

\section{Implementation of SMPS Writer}

We describe our Julia implementation, how to model SIP and generate SMPS files..


\section{Problem descriptions}

In this section, we introduce each problem in \texttt{SIPLIB 2.0}. More than one formulation per problem possibly exist based on the reference papers. For each problem, we provide various size of instances as a default. We also explain the scenario data generation procedure for each problem. %This does not mean that users need to know the whole procedure in order to generate new scenario data. Those who feel the given instances are not large enough can simply generate more scenario data by just modifying the parameter corresponding to the number of scenarios.
