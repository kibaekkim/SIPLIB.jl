DUAL DECOMPOSITION ITERATION INFORMATION:
* master   = objective function value of the master problem.
* primobj  = best primal objective function value.
* dualobj  = best dual objective function value.
* a.gap(%) = Approximate gap between master and dualobj.
* d.gap(%) = Duality gap between primobj and dualobj.
* times    = wall clock time in seconds.
